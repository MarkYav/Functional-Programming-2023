# Functional Programming 2023
Functional programming university course.

## Lab 1
Develop an information system "Faculty Network Newspaper".
The database tables contain the following information: Title of the article or graphic material, author (...),
annotation text, where publication files are recorded, information about readers and their feedback, 
statistics about individual materials. Provide for the possibility of introduction and correction of information.

## Lab 2
Using Haskell (ghc with the --threaded option), create a multi-threaded application:
Implement Batcher's "exchange merge sort" for a given array using k threads (k is specified from the keyboard).

## Problems
1. Find such a path of the knight on the chessboard that it visits each square only once.
2. Create a multilayer perceptron, learning by the method of back propagation of error.
3. Solve the travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm.
4. Determine all paths in the connected graph from one selected vertex to another.
5. Using sockets and the threepenny library, create a chat with a graphical interface
6. Create an XML file and its corresponding DTD definition.
7. Using OpenGL, create a Haskell application that simulates the collision of two balls.
8. Write a program to hide information in a gif file (use the last significant bit to hide information). Use the GD library.
